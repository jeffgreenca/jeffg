      ## Jeff's Reading Shortlist

      #### Technical and Career
      * How Complex Systems Fail
        * Nearly any profession with operational responsibility will benefit
        * https://www.adaptivecapacitylabs.com/HowComplexSystemsFail.pdf

      #### Security
      * IBM and the Holocaust

      * Liars and Outliars
        * https://www.schneier.com/books/liars-and-outliers/

      #### DevOps
      * Google SRE Woorkbook
        * https://sre.google/workbook/table-of-contents/
      * The DevOps Handbook
        * Worth a read - more concrete than the Phoenix Project
        * https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-devops-handbook/9781457191381/

      #### Broader Topics
      * Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most

        * https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8725111-why-meditate

      #### Fun Stuff
      * Every Tool's a Hammer: Life is What You Make It
        * I found Adam Savage's book surprisingly relevant to software engineering
        * https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43319933
      * If I Understood You, Would I Have This Look On My Face?
        * A fair bit of fluff but a useful and fun read. Audiobook is narrated by Alan Alda himself.
